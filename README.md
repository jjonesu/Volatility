changepid.py: Volatility plugin to edit the PID of a process in a vmem file; for help vol.[py|exe] changepid -h. There may be other (and better) ways to do this at scale and on live VM systems using VMI, etc.; this plugin was written as a proof of concept to support related work on hidden process detection.
